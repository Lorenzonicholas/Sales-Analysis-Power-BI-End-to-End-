## Introduction

In this exercise, real-world **CrossFit Games 2019** data will be used to practice preparing, cleaning, and organizing data in Tableau. The connection to multiple data sources will be established, and they will be combined through **unions** and **joins**. The **data interpreter** will be enabled for cleanup, and basic transformations such as field type changes, field grouping, and value splitting will be carried out.

By the end of this assignment, **data source filters** will be applied, an **extract** will be created, and the work will be saved as a packaged Tableau workbook (.twbx) or published to **Tableau Public**. Through this process, raw competition data will be transformed into a clean, structured dataset ready for visualization and insights.

## 1 Data Connection and Integration

In the Data Source Interface window, the **Homework\_1\_Crossfit\_Games\_2019 Excel file** should be connected, and the following actions should be performed:

* The **2019\_games\_athletes\_men** source should be brought in and the **Data Interpreter** should be enabled.

### 1.1 Union the `2019_games_athletes_women` source to your main table

* The `2019_games_athletes_men` sheet should first be **double-clicked** so that it opens in the canvas.
    
* The `2019_games_athletes_women` sheet should then be **dragged beneath** the men’s sheet.
    
* A **union should be created automatically** once the sheet is placed.
    
* The **columns should be matched** by name and type to ensure the union aligns correctly.

### 1.2 Create a Left Join with the `2019_games_scores` table

* The **unioned athletes table (men + women)** should first be **double-clicked** so that it opens in the table’s (physical) canvas.
    
* The `2019_games_scores` sheet should then be **dragged into the same canvas** (onto the unioned table area) so that the **join dialog is opened**.
    
* The **join key should be set** to `Competitorid` = `Competitorid` on both sides.
    
* The **join type should be changed** to **Left Join** (icon showing all rows from the left table).

## **2 Field Updates and Transformations**

### 2.1 Change **Ordinal** field to **String** (passive steps)

* In the **Data Source** tab, the **Ordinal** column should be **located** in the grid.
    
* The **data-type icon** (e.g., `#`/`Abc`) in the column header should be **clicked**.
    
* **String** should be **selected** from **Change Data Type**.
    
* The change should be **verified** by confirming the header shows **Abc** (text icon).
